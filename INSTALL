Chances are this package is NOT going to install properly through CPAN.
There are some dependencies that are not perl things.


Change into the directory holding this file.

	perl Makefile.PL

If you see any missing modules like File::Which

	cpan File::Which

After that 

	make test

This should take a minute or more.

If it fails, you may be missing non perl prerequisites...

1) INSTALLING PREREQUISITES
===========================

DEPENDENCIES

ImageMagick convert
xpdf pdfimages
PDF::GetImages
PDF::Burst
CAM::PDF
PDF::API2


There are a few dependencies you will need to meet. Things that are not necessarily perl.
You must install tesseract, and.. 
Here's what you should have:

t1lib 
freetype 
freetype-devel 
libpaper 
libpaper-devel 
libpng 
xpdf 
ghostscript 
openmotif 
openmotif-devel 
freetype2

Changes are you have most of these.

Misc Notes:

You should also test out pdfimages (from xpdf)
This utility extracts images from a pdf

have to make sure if you build xpdf, that you use 
./configure --with-freetype2-includes=/path/to/freetyp2 dir


INSTALLING TESSERACT

You may be able to simply install the SVN version of Tesseract by using:

 svn checkout http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tesseract-ocr
 ./runautoconf
 mkdir build-directory
 cd build-directory
 ../configure
 make
 make install


for more see google project on ocr, they use tesseract



2) INSTALLING
=============

Back in the directory holding the package (and this file).

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test

It should work. Now you install.

	make install

There.

Enjoy!
