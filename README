This is a collection of tools to make life with ocr a little easier on linux.
For example, if you have an image and you want to read it with tesseract, it needs to be a tif- 
the included script bin/ocr will make a temp tif file for you and read that instead

so you can run ocr on any image type without bothering with the details of image format


Please also read the INSTALL file.
